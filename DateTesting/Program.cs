     * Your mission, should you choose to accept it...
     * 
     * We have a client who has a concept of fiscal months. We
     * need you to write a method that accepts a Date and will
     * return the fiscal month in the format 'January, 2022'.
     * 
     * The client has told us that their fiscal month is
     * defined as follows:
     *  - If the day is at or before the 22nd of the month, the 
     *    fiscal month will be the prior month.
     *  - If the day is after the 22nd of the month, the fiscal
     *    month will be the current month.
     *  - Example: 
     *      Date is 2022-06-01, fiscal month is 'May, 2022'.
     *      Date is 2022-06-24, fiscal month is 'June, 2022'.
     * 
     * Utilize the DateUnitTests project to prove out your
     * method.
     * 
     * There are no restrictions here, you may use Google,
     * StackOverflow, etc. to help you along the way. Also,
     * feel free to ask any questions should you need help or
     * are unclear on what you need to do.
